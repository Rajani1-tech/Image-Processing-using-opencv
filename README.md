# Image-Processing-using-opencv
Image processing involves using mathematical and computational techniques to manipulate digital images. Its goal is to enhance, compress, or extract information from images, and automate tasks that would be time-consuming for humans.

Image processing can be applied to various applications like medical imaging, satellite image analysis, computer vision, robotics, facial recognition, and image-based pattern recognition.

It can be categorized into two types: analog and digital image processing. However, digital image processing is more prevalent today due to the widespread use of digital imaging devices.


Analog vs digital image
Phases in image processing

1. Image Acquisition
A camera captures an image which is then digitized for processing in a computer.

2. Image Enhancement
Image manipulation techniques are used to enhance acquired images by highlighting important details like contrast and brightness adjustment, etc. However, image enhancement is subjective in nature.

3. Image Restoration
This step enhances image appearance by removing noise or blur, which can be attributed to a mathematical or probabilistic model.

4. Color Image Processing
Process colored images (16-bit RGB/RGBA) for color correction or modeling.

5. Wavelets and Multi-Resolution Processing
Wavelets are used to represent images at different resolutions by subdividing them into smaller regions.

6. Image Compression
Images are often compressed when they need to be transferred or due to storage constraints. This is also important for displaying images online, as small thumbnails are highly compressed versions of the original. Clicking on the image displays it in its original resolution, which saves bandwidth on servers.

7. Morphological Processing
Morphological processing uses mathematical operations to extract image components for downstream tasks. For example, erosion and dilation operations are used to sharpen and blur object edges in an image.

8. Image Segmentation
Image segmentation involves dividing an image into key parts for simplified analysis. By focusing on important details, automated systems can perform better.

9. Representation and Description
This step decides to depict the segmented region as boundary or complete region. Description extracts attributes for quantitative information or object differentiation.

10. Object Detection and Recognition
Automated systems need to label segmented objects to indicate what has been detected, such as “vehicle” or “person”.

11. Knowledge Base
Information about an object’s location and label can be encoded into the knowledge base to help solve the task at hand.

Image Processing Technique
Image processing can be used to enhance image quality, remove undesired objects, or even create new images. It’s a vast field with various techniques. We will focus on common image-processing tasks in this section.

1. Image Enhancement
Image enhancement is a common image-processing task with crucial applications in various fields. One approach is adjusting the contrast and brightness of an image, which can be done automatically or manually using image editing software.


2. Image restoration
Image restoration is a process of improving the quality of a degraded or damaged image to recover the original, undistorted version. Various factors can contribute to image degradation, including noise, blurring, and other artifacts. Image restoration techniques aim to mitigate these effects and enhance the visual quality of the image.

One common method for image restoration is the use of a restoration filter, such as a deblurring filter or a denoising filter.


3. Image Segmentation
Image segmentation is a computer vision task that involves dividing an image into different segments or regions based on certain characteristics, such as color, intensity, or texture. The goal is to simplify the representation of an image into meaningful and semantically coherent parts. Each segment typically corresponds to a specific object or region of interest within the image.


4. Object Detection
Object detection is the task of identifying and locating objects in images or videos. It is a fundamental element in various applications, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and more. CNNs are a popular approach for object detection, and TensorFlow’s object detection API offers an easy way to implement it using pre-trained models.


5. Image compression
Image compression reduces digital image file size without compromising its visual quality. There are two types of compression: lossless and lossy. Lossless compression preserves every detail, while lossy compression discards some information. Common compression algorithms include JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP. The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application’s requirements.


OpenCV is a powerful and versatile framework for image processing in Python. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for tasks like resizing, cropping, edge detection, image enhancement, and object detection. OpenCV can also be used for feature extraction, image segmentation, and machine learning applications in computer vision.
